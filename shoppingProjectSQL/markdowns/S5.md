## WORKING WITH EXPRESS.JS

---

### **INSTALLING EXPRESS.JS**

- Command

  ```
    npm install --save express
  ```

  to the terminal or command prompt.

- Import the express module in app.js file.

  ```
    const express = require("express");
  ```

- Create an express object in app.js file.

  ```
    const app = express();
  ```

- You may add middlewares by using app.use() method.

  ```
    app.use("/some-path", callback => {});
  ```

  Note that if your callback function in middleware is not returning anything, you need to end your function with "next()", otherwise function will be terminated automatically.

  You may limit the middleware to post or get methods to handle the accessibility of the pages by user. For example if a log in page displaying, user must not be able to accessing main application by just changing the URL, he/she must be redirected with post method of application page rather than the get method.

### **HANDLING ROUTES**

- By convention, js files of your application are under the "routes" folder. For every js file of pages, you need to use Router property of express module and export it for app.js to use.

  ```
  const router = express.Router();
  router.post("/path", callback => {});
  module.exports.routes = router;
  //or removing "module" will be fine.
  ```

- Import the related js file in app.js file.

  ```
    const xpageData = require("path of js file");
    app.use(xpageData.routes);
  ```

  Note that the most non-specific path must be placed after the other paths in app.js file while routing.

### **RECORD 75: SERVING FILES STATICALLY**

- Create a public/css folder.
- Create css files for each page of your application.
- Add

  ```
  app.use(express.static(path.join(\_\_dirname, "public")))
  ```

  to your app.js file.

- Add

  ```
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css" />
  ```

  to your page's html file.
